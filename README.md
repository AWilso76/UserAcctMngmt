# Logs example

The first three entries reflect my attempts in creating new users awilso718 and awils,and I failed. 
I closed the PyCharm application, on the desktop I right clicked on the PyCharm icon and selected run as administrator, and gave permission for the application to make system changes. 
then script began to work on my Windows 10 operating system.
