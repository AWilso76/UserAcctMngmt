# User Account Management
Created a python script which creates, deletes and modifies user accounts.

enabling, disabling, and listing user accounts. The script is especially useful for system administrators who want to streamline user account management.

# List Users

The first two entries reflect my two attempts of creating a new user awilso718, and they failed. 
I closed PyCharm application, on the desktop I clicked on the PyCharm icon and selected run as administrator, gave permission for the application to make system changes. 
I was then able to get the script to work on my Windows 10 operating system.
