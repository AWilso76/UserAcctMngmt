7. Log File
The first two entries reflect my two attempts of creating a new user awilso718, and they failed. I closed PyCharm application, on the desktop I clicked on the PyCharm icon and selected run as administrator, gave permission for the application to make system changes. I was then able to get the script to work on my Windows 10 operating system.
